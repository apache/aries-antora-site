I've staged a release candidate for Aries 0.2-incubating. The
following Aries top level modules are staged and tagged in
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/aries/tags/ 

The artifacts are in two staged repos. Links to the *.zip files for each module are provided below. The source should be built in the order given below because there are dependencies between some of the modules.

The RAT and IANAL build checks passed. Note that, although RAT is configured to ignore *.MF and other files that do not require the ASF licence, theses files are still reported incorrectly as RAT failures.

The vote will be open for 72 hours.
