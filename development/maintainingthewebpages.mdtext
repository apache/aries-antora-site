# How the Aries web site works

The Aries site is built using CMS. To edit the site you must be an Aries committer, the 
ID and password are the same ones as you use for Aries SVN.

The easiest way to edit pages is to install the CMS bookmarklet as described [here](https://cms.apache.org/#bookmark)

The steps in making a change to the site are:

  - Edit
  - Submit
  - Commit your changes
  - Check the 'staged' site
  - If the content looks good, publish the site

The Wiki syntax is called Markdown and is documented [here](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/). Some extensions are installed in 
the CMS system (eg tables, syntax highlighting). 

More information on CMS is 
available [here](http://wiki.apache.org/general/ApacheCms2010)
