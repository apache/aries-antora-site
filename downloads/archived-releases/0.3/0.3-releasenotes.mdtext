### New and Noteworthy

Welcome to the 0.3 release. 

 * Compliance tests (TBD)
 * [JIRA Release Notes ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310981&version=12315310)

### New Components
#### Proxy
The proxy component was added in 0.3. Proxy allows you to generate proxyies based on interfaces or classes, eg object damping. Proxy
provides a service to both blueprint and JNDI.

### Major updates
####Â Application.
The application component in 0.3 provides a runtime in which OSGi applications are isolated from
each other, and the provisioning support that it requires. These changes mean that the 0.3 release of aplication is significantly different 
from the 0.2 release.
<p>The resolver also supports external bundle repositories in 0.3.</p>

#### Blueprint
Blueprint namespace support has been added. This makes it possible to look up Blueprint components from Web or 
Persistence bundles.
