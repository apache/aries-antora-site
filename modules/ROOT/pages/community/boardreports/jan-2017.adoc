== Issues:

* There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

== Activity:

* As a community we made 3 releases this quarter and 3 further releases currently under vote, and added Johannes Utzig as a new committer.

== Health report:

* The PMC were requested by the board to consider if there are any potential PMC candidates among the current committers.
There was some discussion, but no people were decided upon.
This will be discussed again in the coming days.
* A new contribution of the JAX-RS Services OSGi specification Reference Implementation has been contributed from Carlos Sierra Andr√©s.
This specification is currently in draft.
* The number of subscribers to the dev@ user@ private@ and commits@ lists are roughly consistent (down by 0-3 in the last 3 months).
* The dev@ list traffic is consistent, while the user@ traffic has been down over last three months.
However, there has been a wide variety of discussion across the different modules within Aries.
* Despite 32 issues being closed off, the number opened was slightly higher in the past 3 months.
