= March 2010 Board Report

Aries will deliver a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise OSGi application programming model.

Aries entered incubation on September 22, 2009.

There are currently no issues requiring IPMC or Board attention .

The following sub-components are actively being developed:

* Application
* Blueprint
* JMX
* JPA

Several new sample applications have been developed to demonstrate the Aries functionality.

A new component has been created to feed experience into the OSGi standards process.

There has been a lot of activity on the mailing list this year indicating a vibrant community is being built.

One new committer, Rex Wang, has been added.
Redhat have started to participate in the project.

We have begun the process of doing a 0.1.0 release and aim to release shortly.

Top 2 or 3 things to resolve before graduation:

* Build community
* Create a release
* Address project scope concerns raised during acceptance vote
