= March 2011 Board report

Aries delivers a set of pluggable Java components enabling an enterprise OSGi application programming model.

== New releases

These bug fix releases have been completed since the last board report:

* Aries Application 0.2.1
* Aries Blueprint 0.2.1
* Aries Blueprint 0.3.1

== Release by bundle

After some significant investigation and discussion, we recently concluded a vote to switch to a release-by-bundle scheme.
This is to enable us to follow the guidance set out in the OSGi Alliance Semantic Versioning white paper.

The dev@ list continues to be active with less traffic on the user@ list.
