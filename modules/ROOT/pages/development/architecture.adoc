= Module build time dependencies

There are build time dependencies between Aries modules.
This diagram shows the dependencies.
For example, if you need to build 0.2-incubating JPA module you will find that you need to have built (or have available) parent, testsupport, util, blueprint, quiesce and transaction at the level specified in the pom.xml for the JPA module.
