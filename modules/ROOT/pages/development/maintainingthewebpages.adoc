= Maintaining The Web Site

The web site is built with https://antora.org[Antora] run through https://ci-builds.apache.org[Apache Jenkins CI] and published to a https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=aries-site-pub.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/asf-site[dedicated git repository] with an https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/INFRA/Git+-+.asf.yaml+features#Git.asf.yamlfeatures-WebSiteDeploymentServiceforGitRepositories[.asf.yaml] https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=aries-site-pub.git;a=blob;f=.asf.yaml;hb=HEAD[configuration file].

== Overall organization

For simplicity, this references the GitHub mirrors of the Apache gitbox repos.

General content::
Content not specific to a particular subproject and unmigrated content is in the https://github.com/apache/aries-antora-site[aries-antora-site] repository.
At the moment there is only one Antora component, version, and module, so the content is all under `modules/ROOT/pages`.

Subproject-specific content::
Content specific to a subproject may be put in the subproject repo in the standard Antora layout.
For instance, SCR content could be in `aries` under `scr/docs/modules/ROOT/pages`.
This feature is not yet used.

Antora playbook::
The Antora playbook together with  the Node project to fetch and set up the required dependencies is in the https://github.com/apache/aries-antora[aries-antora] repository.

Antora UI::
The UI for this website is in the https://github.com/apache/aries-antora-ui[aries-antora-ui] repository.
For simplicity this is currently set up as an extension of the Antora default UI using https://gitlab.com/djencks/antora-ui-builder[].

Published site content::
The website build publishes the content to https://github.com/apache/aries-site-pub[aries-site-pub] in the `asf-site` branch.
The `.asf.yaml` file is configured to publish the content to Apache servers.

Automated site build::
The site is built using Jenkins jobs https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Aries/job/website-build[aries/website-build] and https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Aries/job/website-content-trigger[Aries/website-content-trigger].
Committing to the `aries-antora-site` or `aries-antora` repositories will trigger a website build and publish.
Changes to the UI will not trigger an automated build, but PMC members may trigger a build manually with the https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Aries/job/website-build/build?delay=0sec[Build Now] button.
If subproject content is moved to subproject repositories more trigger jobs will be needed.

== Extensions currently in use

https://gitlab.com/djencks/asciidoctor-antora-indexer[asciidoctor-antora-indexer]::
This queries the Antora content catalog and renders the results as lists, tables, etc.
It is currently used in the xref:auto-index.adoc[] page to partially automate generation.

== Basic AsciiDoc

The Intellij AsciiDoc plugin provides extensive syntax checking, side-by-side rendering, and a lot of other help.

Consult the Asciidoctor and Antora documentation for complete coverage of syntax and features.

Please use "ventilated prose", with one sentence per line.

* A blank line indicates a new paragraph.
* A page starts with a title, indicated by `= Title`.
* Sections are marked with `==`, `===`, etc, the number of `=` indicating section nesting.
* Sections are automatically assigned ids that can be used as the fragment in links.
To manually specify an id, precede the section line with `[#my-id]` on a separate line.
* Code blocks look like this:
[source,adoc]
------
[source,java] <1>
----  <2>
class Foo {
...
}
----
------
<1> Any language you want: highlighting is available for most.
<2> Block separator `----`

=== Page links

Between pages::
Use the `xref:` inline macro:
`+++xref:other-page.adoc[]+++`.

* The path to the other page starts from the `pages` directory: it is not relative to the current page.
* For a non-fragment reference, the default link text is the other page title.
Custom text may be specified inside the `[]` brackets.
* For fragment references you must specify the link text.

Within a page::
Use the form `+++<<#_fragment_name, link text>>+++`.
For a link to a section, the default link text is the section title.

NOTE: The Intellij asciidoc plugin has Antora-aware syntax checking and auto-complete, including the generated section ids.


== Local build

You need Node and npm installed.
You also need git to clone the repositories locally, but the build itself does not use git.

I do not recommend following the instructions on the Antora site, which advise installing Antora globally.
The playbook project is instead set up to use an npm script to install Antora and all required dependencies locally
At a minimum:

* Clone the `aries-antora` playbook project.
* Run `npm run plain-install`.
* Run `npm run build`.

This will build the site locally into build/site, using the remote content sources, such as `aries-antora-site`.

Most likely you will want to modify content sources locally, and build using your local sources, before committing and pushing your changes.
To enable this:

* Clone the `aries-antora-site` repository and any other content repositories you wish to work with next to the playbook project.
* Modify the `antora-playbook.yml` to point to the local clones rather than the remote repositories.
Be sure to specify `branches: HEAD` to use the worktree content rather than the local committed repository content.
The appropriate changes are already in the playbook, commented out, with comments, for the `aries-antora-site` repository.
* Build the site as above.

=== Working with the UI

* Clone the `aries-antora-ui` project next to the playbook project.
* Run `npm i`.
* Run `./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js` to assemble the UI.
* To see the results, run `cp build/aries-antora-ui-bundle.zip ../aries-antora/node_modules/@apache-aries/aries-antora-ui/build/aries-antora-ui-bundle.zip` and build the playbook project.
* When you are satisfied with your changes, commit both source changes and the assembled UI bundle and push to the remote repository.
* UI bundle changes do not trigger a site build; you'll need to start one manually.

Most likely making changes to src/partials/* templates will be fairly self-explanatory.
Other changes are likely to need a fairly detailed understanding of the Antora default UI.
