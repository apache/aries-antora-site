= EBA Maven Plugin

The EBA Maven Plugin provides the ability to generate EBA archives using Maven.
The EBA archive format is described in link:applications.html[Applications] .  An EBA archive can optionally contain an Application manifest (APPLICATION.MF).
This can be added in one of two ways

. Hand written and added into the archive.
. Generated based on pom configuration.

== Using the Plugin

The plugin is included by as follows:

     <build>
 	<plugins>
 	    <plugin>
 		<groupId>org.apache.aries</groupId>
 		<artifactId>eba-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 	    </plugin>
 	</plugins>
     </build>

By default it will not generate a manifest, so in the above example it will attempt to copy a pre-defined APPLICATION.MF from src/main/resources/META-INF.
If that file does not exist, then no application manifest will be included.

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-GeneratinganAPPLICATION.MF">++++++</a>+++

== Generating an APPLICATION.MF

The following example shows how to get the plugin to generate an APPLICATION.MF based on the pom configuration:

     <build>
 	<plugins>
 	    <plugin>
 		<groupId>org.apache.aries</groupId>
 		<artifactId>eba-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 		<configuration>
 		    <generateManifest>true</generateManifest>
 		</configuration>
 	    </plugin>
 	</plugins>
     </build>

The pom to application manfiest header mapping is as follows:

* Pom +++<groupId>++++++</groupId>+++.+++<artifactId>++++++</artifactId>+++ \-> Application-SymbolicName
* Pom +++<name>++++++</name>+++ \-> Application-Name
* Pom +++<version>++++++</version>+++ \-> Application-Version (cleaned up for OSGi)
* Pom +++<description>++++++</description>+++ \-> Application-Description
* Pom +++<dependencies>++++++</dependencies>+++ \-> Application-Content

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-OverridingApplication-SymbolicName">++++++</a>+++

== Overriding Application-SymbolicName

The application symbolic name defaults to the ${project.groupId}.${project.artifaceId}.
The following shows how to override this:

 <configuration>
   <instructions>
     <Application-SymbolicName>${project.artifaceId}</Application-SymbolicName>
   </instructions>
 </configuration>

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-AddingApplication-ExportServiceandApplication-ImportServiceheaders">++++++</a>+++

== Adding Application-ExportService and Application-ImportService headers

The application import service and export service headers can be set as follows.
The text inside the elements is included as-is.

 <configuration>
   <instructions>
     <Application-ExportService>...</Application-ExportService>
     <Application-ImportService>...</Application-ImportService>
   </instructions>
 </configuration>

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-AddingUseBundleheader">++++++</a>+++

== Adding the Use-Bundle header

The application Use-Bundle header can be set as follows.
The text inside the elements is included as-is.

 <configuration>
   <instructions>
     <Use-Bundle>...</Use-Bundle>
   </instructions>
 </configuration>

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-Includingtransitivedependencies">++++++</a>+++

== Including transitive dependencies (deprecated)

This configuration option is deprecated in favor of +++<archiveContent>++++++</archiveContent>+++.

By default, the archive will only include the direct dependencies of the project.
Transitive dependencies can be includes as follows:

 <configuration>
   <useTransitiveDependencies>true</useTransitiveDependencies>
 </configuration>

+++<a name="EBAMavenPluginProject-Archivecontent">++++++</a>+++

== Including bundles in the archive

By default, the archive will only include the direct dependencies of the project.
The `<archiveContent/>` element can be used to control the archive artifact contents.
The following shows how to include all direct and transitive dependencies.

 <configuration>
   <archiveContent>all</archiveContent>
 </configuration>

The following shows how to exclude all dependencies from the archive.
This is useful if you just want the application definition and will use a bundle repository to provision the bundles during deployment.

 <configuration>
   <archiveContent>none</archiveContent>
 </configuration>

The following specifies the default of including only the direct dependencies (assumes the application contents and direct dependencies are the same).

 <configuration>
   <archiveContent>applicationContent</archiveContent>
 </configuration>
